Cancer Incidence vs Food Systems, Lifestyle & Economic Conditions
Overview
The project explores the relationship between global food systems, lifestyle habits, economic conditions and cancer incidence within each region defined any world organisation.

Research Questions
1. How do food system indicators relate to cancer incidence across countries? 
This question explores whether improvements in food system indicators like food environment, quality and affordability are associated with higher or lower cancer rates globally.
 
3. Do patterns of cancer incidence differ across World Bank income groups and WHO regions? 
This research question tries to find across different regions and whether cancer rates are influenced by detection capacity, lifestyle, or demographic factors.

5. Does tobacco prevalence correlate with cancer incidence, and does this relationship differ across regions and income levels? 
Tobacco is one of the most recognized cancer risk factors; this question evaluates whether the data supports that relationship globally.
